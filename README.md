Oct-7-Assignment
================

First day of Code Fellows bootcamp! This app was purely to demonstrate that we could have more than one server running at the same time (with the Rails built-in WEBrick server and also through a bash script provided to us), as well as to immerse us in the idea of BDD as a way of thinking by throwing a testing challenge at us on the first day instead of actually making an app with content.
